Recipes Project for Odin - Practicing HTML

This Repo is primarily designed as a refresher for my HTML skills, walking through basic formatting and setting up a page structure.

Lessons learned (To be completed after project completion):
1. Having to ctrl+e or cmnd+right arrow to the end of each auto-completing html command is irritating.
2. HTML does come back to you quick.
3. A fun exercise to work without styling, and a good reminder that most recipe websites overcomplicated their design and make it more difficult to reach the actual content of the recipe.
4. A good start! Excited to move onto future projects, working with flexbox!
