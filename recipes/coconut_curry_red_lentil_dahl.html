        <p>
            It's almost impossible to mess up this lentil dahl. A perfect 
            dish for leftovers, a delight to eat piping hot or pulled 
            out from the fridge. Excellent sweetness, creamy textures. 
            Don't forget to go heavier on the spices, garlic, and ginger!

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Using a strainer or colander, rinse the rice under cold, 
                running water, then drain and transfer to a medium 
                saucepan. Add broth and bring the mixture to a boil over 
                high heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, wash and dry the fresh produce.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the liquid comes to a boil, stir the mixture, cover 
                the saucepan, and reduce heat to low. Cook rice until 
                liquid is full absorbed, 15-18 minutes. Once done, 
                remove rice from the heat and let it stand, still covered, 
                for 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                While the rice is cooking, peel and mince ginger and garlic; 
                place in a small bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Quarter jalapeño peppers lengthwise; seed and remove ribs 
                with a spoon. Mince and add to the bowl with the ginger 
                and the garlic.
            </li>
            <li>
                Peel and small dice onions.
            </li>
            <li>
                 Preheat another medium saucepan over medium heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the pan is hot, add oil and swirl to coat the bottom. 
                Add ginger, garlic, jalapeño, onion, and spices to the 
                pan. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is soft, 
                8-12 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, rinse the lentils in a colander or strainer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add lentils, broth, and coconut milk to the pan. Bring the 
                mixture to a boil over high heat; once boiling, reduce to 
                a simmer, cover, and cook until the lentils are just 
                tender, about 20-40 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                While the lentils are cooking, quarter tomatoes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Shave cilantro leaves off the stems; discard stems and 
                mince the leaves.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the lentils are done, add tomatoes and half the 
                cilantro (reserving the rest for garnish) to the pan; 
                stir to combine and continue to cook until heated 
                through, 2-3 minutes more.
            </li>
            <li>
                To serve, divide lentils and rice between bowls; top 
                with reserved cilantro and enjoy!
