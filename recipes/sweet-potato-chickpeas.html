        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Looking for a simple, easy meal, that's absolutely delightful, full of
             flavor, and never gets old? Look no further. This is one of my favorite 
             meals. It was also how I even started with cooking. I will still make it 
             every couple months because it's such a fantastic melding of flavors.
        </p>
        <p>This recipe mixes the sweet dryness of sweet potatoes with the savory
            crunch of roasted chickpeas. The tomatoes add a breath of acidity while
            the garlic-yogurt sauce adds a liquidity that freshens up the dish and
            prevents it from being too dry. It helped foster a love of cooking for
            me, and started me on my own cooking journey. I'll forever be grateful
            to this meal, and I'll never stop eating it! Highly recommend you give
            it a shot as well.

            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>2 pints grape tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 small bunch Italian (flat-leaf) parsley</li>
            <li>2 lemons</li>
            <li>1 cup plain Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>2lb sweet potatoes</li>
            <li>black pepper</li>
            <li>cinnamon, ground</li>
            <li>coriander, ground</li>
            <li>cumin, ground</li>
            <li>dill, dried</li>
            <li>extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>paprika</li>
            <li>salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a large sheet pan with 
                aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Wash and dry the fresh produce.</li>
            <li>Peel and cut sweet potatoes lengthwise into 4-6 wedges each, 
                depending on size, then transfer to the sheet pan. Drizzle 
                with oil and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Spread wedges out in an even layer, then place in oven
                and bake for 10 minutes, until potatoes begin to soften slightly.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, drain and rinse the beans in a colander; set aside to
                drain further.
            </li>
            <li>Juice on lemon into a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Place drained chickpeas in the bowl with the lemon juice; add oil, 
                cumin, coriander, paprika, cinnamon, and salt. Toss to coat.
            </li>
            <li>Remove sweet potatoes from the oven and flip using tongs. Sprinkle
                chickpeas (and any leftover seasoning) over the sweet potatoes in an
                even layer and return to the oven. Bake until chickpeas become crispy
                and potatoes can be pierced easily with a fork, 20-25 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, grate the zest from the remaining lemon into a small bowl, 
                then juice into the same bowl.
            </li>
            <li>Peal and mince garlic; add to the bowl with the lemon zest and juice.</li>
            <li>Add yogurt, dill, salt, and pepper to the bowl and whisk to combine 
                the sauce. Add 2-3 tablespoons cold water, if needed, to reach 
                drizzling consistency.
            </li>
            <li>Halve the grape tomatoes crosswise.</li>
            <li>Shave parsley leaves off the stems; discard the stems and mince
                the leaves.
            </li>
            <li>To server, divide potatoes and chickpeas between plates. Top with
                tomatoes, parsley, and garlic-yogurt sauce. Enjoy!
            </li>
