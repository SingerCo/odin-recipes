        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Who doesn't love a nice spicy warm soup on a cold winter's day? 
            If you're looking for one, this delicious tomato-rice soup is 
            a perfect place to start. A stupendous backing base of onion, 
            chili-garlic sauce, and some garlic and ginger is blended 
            with rice and zucchini to create a rich, creamy soup that will 
            tingle your toes and your tongue.

            It's also a great way to pick up spicing a dish. When I was 
            learning to cook, one thing I appreciated about this meal is 
            how adaptable it was. You get the chance to adjust spices 
            and add a dollop of what you think it could use a bit more of, 
            but in two places! Right before you puree the soup, and at 
            the very end of cooking. I like to add some cayenne for some 
            extra spice, but some cumin, perhaps some basil would be a 
            nice touch too.

            <li>32 fl oz chicken or vegetable broth</li>
            <li>1 small bunch cilantro</li>
            <li>1 (13.5 fl oz) can coconut milk</li>
            <li>2 (14.5 oz) cans diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic (double if you have taste)</li>
            <li>2 (1 inch) pieces ginger root</li>
            <li>1 medium yellow onion</li>
            <li>2 medium zucchini squash</li>
            <li>chili-garlic sauce</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>virgin coconut oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash and dry the fresh produce.</li>
            <li>Peel and mince garlic and ginger.</li>
            <li>Preheat a large pot over medium heat.</li>
            <li>While the pot heats up, peel and small dice onion.</li>
            <li>Once the pot is hot, add oil and swirl to coat the bottom. Add garlic, 
                ginger, onion, 2 tsp chili-garlic sauce, and salt; cook, stirring 
                occasionally, until onion begins to soften, 6-8 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Add broth, tomatoes, and coconut milk to the pot. Bring to a boil over 
                high heat, then reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, 
                for 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, trim and halve zucchini lengthwise, then slice crosswise 
                into half rounds.
            </li>
            <li>Drain and rinse beans.</li>
            <li>Puree the soup with an immersion blender or regular blender. Return 
                pureed soup to the pot and stir in zucchini, beans, and rice.
            </li>
            <li>Bring soup to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to low. Cover 
                and simmer, stirring occasionally, until rice is tender, about 15-18 
                minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, shave cilantro leaves off the stems; discard stems and 
                mince the leaves.
            </li>
            <li>To serve, divide soup between bowls and top with cilantro. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
